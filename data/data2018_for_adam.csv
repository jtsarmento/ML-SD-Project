People are constantly leaving the mall to turn right on that road to get onto Friars road and even though their light is red they assume they have a right of way. However, those coming from Friars Rd and turning left or making a U-Turn on Avenida De Las Tiendas have the right of way. It also doesn't help with all the construction on the roads on Friars Rd.

I hate to have to report this, but when we live in area and can't find parking ourselves, he needs to be respectful and move on to other streets. Often times we can't find parking on our street and I don't feel comfortable parking several blocks away.  This blue van has been parking like this on and off in front of 2353 for over 1year.","Aug","Short",16:34:00,2018-08-20,"Summer","Afternoon",170,906

Even after a second attempt at fixing the shoddy workmanship it is sub-power and has ""fallen apart"". It was done in sections of a few blocks, AND one block was left completely unpaved!!!  This was VERY BAD PLANNING. I'm guessing that more than one contractor was used, which would probably account for this planning, with neither crew taking responsibility for the unpaved block of Milton! I'm not a road paver, but I'd hazard a guess that the preparation of the original road surface was lacking proper protocol! I know other residents in this area, and other commuters frequenting the area, submitted request to remedy this problem, so I haven't included photos. Many drivers going to Longfellow, Bay Park and School of the Madeleine Elementary schools are sorely affected by these potholes with many families going out of their way to avoid this section of public roadway.","Dec","Long",16:41:00,2018-12-27,"Winter","Afternoon",171,1024

I'm the owner of the home 5002 Litchfield      Road, San Diego 92116. I can be reached at 619-889-8404 for      questions, or email at 125mph@gmail.com.      There is a red zone on the street corner of Litchfield Road and      North Mountain View Drive.  It is right where my house is      located. I used to be able to park two cars between the corner of      the street and my drive way, but the last time that red zone got      repainted, it was repainted to red zone too far by 2-3 feet, and      now I can only park one car there without getting a ticket. I      would like to request the extra red be taken off as it was not      there before, and is way protruding into a neutral area. It's      also wasteful space if only one car can park there. If you could      paint that area white again by removing the red 2-3 feet, that      would be very helpful. I walked around the whole neighborhood and      I see only my street has this prolonged red zone.      I emailed about last month to trafficops@sandiego.gov but I got      no response. My email included pictures. I can send pictures if      you need.","Jan","Long",08:58:00,2018-01-24,"Winter","Morning",199,1163

This causes puddles of foul smelling water and attracts pests. Ive reported this under other 167 days ago, illegal discharge, and street flooding but i do not see anything being done about it. This is getting ridiculous, i have to wake up and sweep in front and around my property every morning. Something needs to be done about this.

Not seeing the metal post sticking up next to the car, my foot immediately caught up on the metal sticking up and I was thrown to the ground causing my knee to spilt open, cutting my elbow, spraining my wrist, bruising my hip, back and shoulder as well as ripping my pants, shirt, breaking my sunglasses and damaging my purse.

Even the presence of as many as three bicycles will not trigger a green arrow. No wires are visible in the roadway so it's possible that cyclists simply cannot see where they need to position their bicycles to trigger the light. Bicyclists are forced to wait for a car to join them in the left turn lane and this can take many green/red cycles (sometimes many minutes of waiting). The center lane vegetation has now matured and gotten too big for bicyclists to see oncoming traffic to turn safely onto Four Gee Road against the red light.

Also it seems that - even given the report number -  he was unable to view the original report via this (Get It Done) website. Now, this is not the first report of mine referred to this agency that has not been addressed, so I would appreciate it if you would follow up on this and find out why aesgraffitihotline4sdge is not receiving all reports assigned to them, and also why they are apparently unable to view reports at this site.

It only stays green for 4-5 cars, then 1 or 2 run the red light.Cars from that turn lane are now backing up out into lane one and blocking cars going east. This is causing backup of traffic all the way to the I-15 Bridge.This has been happening every afternoon around 5pm and continues until after 6:30pm. Tuesday night 12/4 was the worst I?ve seen in 20 years.It?s bad enough that Santee people cut through our area to save time (which they regretted last night) but now this is causing a 30-minute drive from I-15 to Antigua.This is a new situation that is caused by the signal light timing.Please have this looked at very soon.Thank you for your time.Joe MackeyTierrasanta resident619-995-2348","Dec","Long",10:52:00,2018-12-06,"Fall","Morning",156,926

There is a turn pocket northbound, the only purpose for which is to make a u-turn.  It is very rarely used.  Historically, it was only triggered when traffic was in the lane.  Likewise the southbound Morena to eastbound Avati Dr. was an as-needed signal, cycling green only when triggered by presence of a vehicle.  A few months ago(ish), both became regular rotation signals, meaning, they cycle green, regardless of whether there is a vehicle in need of permission to turn/u-turn.  This extends the time N/S- bound traffic is detained at the intersection unnecessarily, particularly given that a single car needing to turn onto southbound Morena from Avati Drive is sufficient to trigger the whole cycle.  I thought the change might be construction related, but, that no longer seems applicable.  Unnecessary stops and extended idling is wasting time and fuel and adding pollutants to the air.

We have children that live and play here. It is unsafe for them to ride their bikes and for people to walk. They get hit by rocks that cars kick up and trip all the time. For most of us on this street this is our main access to our homes since our garages are on the alley. Having the loose dirt and gravel makes it dangerous as well. We would like to have potholes filled in and alley street swept on occasion. We just recently purchased this home here 2 years ago and have never had the streets swept or maintained. We would love your help in improving the neighboorhood.","Jun","Long",10:21:00,2018-06-29,"Summer","Morning",134,703

At that time there was a section of Chateau Drive between Paola Way and Camber Drive that did not get resurfaced. I assumed that was because some sewage or underlying road work needed to be done first.  It is now June of 2018 and this very rough strip of Chateau Drive has not been resurfaced. I expected that when recently other streets in the neighborhood were resurfaced that this small rough strip of Chateau Drive would be included. It was not.Is there any way that you will consider resurfacing this small rough strip of Chateau Drive in the near future?Sincerely,Dale L.

There are many young children living in this area, including our 3 year old son, an 8-year old boy next door, a 3- and 8-year old brother and sister across the street from us, and two young boys a few houses down across the street ages 2 and 5, respectively. All of the children love to play together and love to ride their bikes and scooters up and down the sidewalks. Without anything slowing traffic all the way from Upas to Dwight, vehicles truly do just fly down this stretch of road and with all of the young children playing together outdoors, it has become a huge neighborhood safety concern. Ideally it would be great to see a stop sign installed. At the very least, a stop sign at Myrtle and 31st. Just SOMETHING to slow traffic down through here.

WHY do cars turning left from Clairemont MB onto Luna Ave get to go before cars turning left and right onto Regents Rd? For some unknown reason YOU change the behavior of these lights in the morning. This morning (10/5/18) for example there ~15 (total from across the street and on my side) cars waiting to turn left onto Regents and 2 cars waiting to turn right onto Regents. This makes no sense what's-so-ever. This happens every time I have to stop and wait where the majority of cars are over ruled by the minority. Please change this. Also allow cars to turn right onto Regents when Regents and Clairemont MB have a green arrow. Because you put in a no turn on red we are having to wait for no good reason. This change has been of no use.","Oct","Long",08:27:00,2018-10-05,"Fall","Morning",148,823

You hit the potholes if you are heading east on Clairemont Mesa and turn left onto Via Valarta at the light.  Both lanes have deep holes which were filled recently but the holes continue to sink and it's very tough to avoid a significant ""clunk"" if you can't steer around them.  I've watched people swing wide to the right and to the left to try and avoid them.

A tow truck was right next to this beater Cadillac at 7:45 a.m., but it did not tow the car. So it?s been five days again, no action, no tickets, no chalking the tires, no towing. The car remains an eyesore and an embarrassment in a fine neighborhood, particularly in light of the SDPD?s stated goals on the web site which are being violated. Things like ?Ensure continuous improvement of operations by identifying best practices in policing? and ?Ensure effective policing by addressing command and community priorities.? But we know how life works, and this lieutenant?s brother-in-law (as neighbors jokingly like to think of him) wins. We now know that storing cars for years on city streets is acceptable in San Diego, even with full knowledge by police.So this will be my last message, but I will send a hard copy in a letter to David Nisleit. He probably won?t see it  but maybe someone on that floor will take it more seriously.  Thank you for your time.","Apr","Long",15:30:00,2018-04-27,"Spring","Afternoon",175,1001

This will much reduce the traffic backup for Mira Mesa Blvd during west-bound rush hours.  There appears no need for 100 sec green light duration for Parkdale Ave as there are not enough cars crossing Mira Mesa Blvd on Parkdale Ave (empty traffic in later of its green light duration while cars are waiting on Mira Mesa Blvd).

There is a possible fire threat ( homeless smoking cigarettes in a dry area ) a mini-fire occurred here a few months back and it burned a few trees. can you trim the dry vegetation ( palm trees that need a trim) at the bottom of the hill are many palm trees not only will clean the place up but also provide an environment that doesn't put driver and pedestrian at risk. And with hot days ahead it will ensure it will not pose a fire risk. Looks like it can affect Kensington and Mission valley area.

Irwin Avenue is located next to Lewis Middle School with residents who are either original home owners (elderly) or are young families with young children. There has been an ongoing problem (for many years) of motorist exceeding the speed limit of 25mph. It is not unusual to witness speeding motorist reach the speeds of 40mph plus at any given point of the day and any day of the week.  After speaking to my nieghbors on Irwin Ave. regarding this issue, all of them complain about this problem and are also very concerned.  We are all willing to sign a petition if needed to have speed bumps install. Please help us keep our street safe before one of us gets seriously injured or killed.

All are located along Salk Institute Road, east of North Torrey Pines Road. 1. Trash Discharge - Grated inlet to the west of the western driveway on Salk Institute Rd. The grated inlet was dry but was littered with a high volume of cigarette butts. (Figure 2 and 3). 2. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.3 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 3. Water Discharge - Grated inlet on the eastern side of the western building near the handicap and deliveries driveway. Here there was a PVC pipe that entered from the north that was flowing at a rate of approximately 0.1 gallons per minute. We were unable to remove the grated inlet and the slits were too narrow to take any samples. The upstream portions of this system are not mapped and are likely private. Photos taken at this location were lost. 4. Inquire - Manhole in the grass between the eastern most driveway cutouts on Salk Institute Rd. Here the manhole was ajar with some equipment nearby. As we did not know what this setup was we did not attempt to move or open the manhole or equipment. The downstream location where this structure is mapped to drain to was dry. There does not appear to be a discharge here, but more information regarding what this setup was would be beneficial. (Figure 4).","Feb","Long",11:17:00,2018-02-28,"Winter","Morning",308,1825

When heading south on Babcock and turning right (west) onto Paseo Del Sur, there are often cars parked near the corner of the intersection, which provides a potentially dangerous situation blocking the view of oncoming traffic heading west on Paseo Del Sur.  I would like to request painting a red curb along the corner of the intersection.  Other corners within that intersection have proper markings to prevent cars from parking unsafely and blocking traffic/view of traffic.  However, due to the roads being fairly new, I feel that this specific corner was possibly overlooked.  Specifically, the curb requesting be painted red is the northeast corner of Paseo Del Sur and Babcock Street.

This has been going on since last Friday and road is right under several windows of the Potiker Senior Residence and is creating  a disturbance in the neighborhood.  There are some residents here that are bedridden or recovering from illnesses or surgeries.

The stop sign itself is not very easy for motorists to see upon approach, and those unfamiliar with the area may not realize they need to stop, because the stenciling on the road is mostly worn away by now. Since pedestrians coming down the stairs from the west may not be at all visible to motorists heading south, until right before pedestrians enter the road, I think it's important that the stenciling on the road be redone so as to make it more obvious that there's a stop sign/crosswalk. Some motorists just blow through that section of Bachman without realizing they need to stop, which is dangerous for pedestrians.","Jul","Long",12:02:00,2018-07-12,"Summer","Afternoon",130,751
